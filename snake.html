    <h2>Snake Plant</h2>
    <h4>Dracaena trifasciata</h4>

    <p>The snake plant is one of the most popular and hardy species of houseplants. The plant features stiff, sword-like leaves and can
      range anywhere from six inches to eight feet tall. Snake plants can vary in color although many have green-banded leaves and commonly
      feature a yellow border. They can survive low light levels, drought and
      have few insect problems. NASA research has even shown that snake plants are able to help keep the air inside your
      home clean, removing toxins such as formaldehyde and benzene.</p>
    <h4>Care</h4>
    They generally grow slowly in indoor light, but increasing the exposure to light will boost growth if it receives a few hours of direct sun.
    Don’t water them too much, especially during the winter. In fact, it’s better to
    let these plants dry out some between waterings as root rot is one of the few problems you could encounter.
    A little general purpose fertilizer can be used if the plants are in a pot.
    A temperature range between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is best. Frost will kill this plant.</p>
